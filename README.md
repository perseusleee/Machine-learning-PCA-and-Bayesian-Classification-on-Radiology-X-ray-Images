# Machine-learning-PCA-and-Bayesian-Classification-on-Radiology-X-ray-Images
X-Ray Image processing and Classification in Python(From Scratch)
Principal component Analysis(For Dimensionality reduction and Feature Extraction)
Bayesian Classifier(Multivariate Gaussian)
Histogram Classifier.

Steps to Do:
Download the data from Kaggle.
Resize the images to your system memory(here I have done 32*32 pixels) and process all of them in pandas/numpy arrays.
Reduce the dimensions using PCA.
Perform Bayesian and Histogram Classification on reduced dimensions of images
